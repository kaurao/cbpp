function [perf, weights, b] = SVR_one_fold(x, y, cv_ind, fold)
% [perf, weights, b] = SVR_one_fold(x, y, cv_ind, fold)
%
% This function runs Support Vector Regression for one cross-validation fold. The relationship between features and 
% targets is assumed to be y = x * weights + b.
%
% Inputs:
%       - x       :
%                  NxP matrix containing P features from N subjects
%       - y       :
%                  NxT matrix containing T target values from N subjects
%       - cv_ind  :
%                  Nx1 matrix containing cross-validation fold assignment for N subjects. Values should range from 1 
%                  to K for a K-fold cross-validation
%       - fold    :
%                  Fold to be used as validation set 
%
% Output:
%       - perf   :
%                 A structure containing the performance metrics: Pearson correlation between predicted and observed 
%                 values ('r_train' and 'r_test'); normalised root mean sqaured deviation between predicted and 
%                 observed values ('nrmsd_train' and 'nrmsd_test')
%       - weights:
%                 Px1 matrix containing weights of the P features
%       - b      :
%                 Intercept value

% the following line fits SVR with default parameters
% however, to be comparable and fair like other methods it will be good to tune SVR
% the two common parameters to tune here would be the BoxCOnstraint (C) and the Epsilon
